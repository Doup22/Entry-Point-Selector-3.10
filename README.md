# Entry-Point-Selector-3.10
Entry Point Selector 3.10 Code 
This is repo is soley to hold on code that is updated and needs updated for EPS to work on SPT 3.10
Currently this mod is broken as fuck for 3.10.
I have not changed any code other than the package.json and the json file that stores all of the spawn points. This mod functions as it should for 3.9.x
